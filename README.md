# Fake News Detection System using Machine Learning

## Abstract
Fake News Detection System is a crucial tool in combating the spread of misinformation, especially in today's digital age where false information can quickly proliferate across various platforms. This project aims to address this issue by employing Machine Learning techniques to predict the authenticity of news articles. By leveraging datasets from the 2016 U.S. Presidential Elections obtained from Kaggle, the project focuses on training models to differentiate between fake and real news articles based on their textual content.

## Introduction
Fake news poses a significant societal problem, influencing public perception and potentially impacting crucial events such as elections. The rise of fake news, particularly during the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election, underscores the urgent need for effective detection mechanisms. Traditional news outlets and social media 
platforms struggle to combat this issue, emphasizing the importance of automated systems for identifying and flagging fake news articles.

## Related Work
Several studies and research efforts have explored various methodologies for fake news detection. From leveraging machine learning algorithms to analyzing social media data, these approaches aim to develop robust systems capable of discerning between genuine and false information sources.

## Proposed System
The Fake News Detection System involves preprocessing and cleaning the data, applying feature engineering techniques, and employing machine learning algorithms for classification. Key components include understanding the characteristics of fake news, selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms, and evaluating their accuracy.

## Results
The performance of different machine learning models is evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting fake news. Models such as Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Passive Aggressive Classifier are assessed, with Passive Aggressive Classifier demonstrating the highest accuracy among the tested models.

## Conclusion and Future Work
The project concludes that Passive Aggressive Classifier is well-suited for predicting fake news using the provided dataset. Future work may involve further refinement of the models, exploration of advanced machine learning techniques, and integration with real-time news monitoring systems to enhance accuracy and scalability.
