# Fake-News-Detection
To tackle the issue of fake news, the project proceeded through several distinct steps:

Problem Identification and Objective Setting: The initial phase involved recognizing the prevalence of fake news and the need for a robust detection mechanism. The primary objective was established: to develop a machine learning solution capable of accurately predicting the authenticity of news articles.

Data Collection: A dataset containing Fake and Real News articles from the 2016 US Presidential Elections was obtained from Kaggle. This dataset served as the foundation for training and testing the machine learning models.

Data Preprocessing: The acquired dataset underwent extensive preprocessing to ensure its suitability for model training. This step included handling missing values, removing irrelevant information, and standardizing the data format.

Feature Engineering: Feature engineering techniques, such as Bag of Words and TF-IDF Vectorization, were applied to convert the textual data into numerical vectors. This transformation enabled the machine learning algorithms to process and analyze the data effectively.

Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms were considered for predicting fake news, including Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Passive Aggressive Classifier. Each algorithm's suitability for the task was evaluated based on its performance metrics and computational efficiency.

Model Training and Evaluation: The selected machine learning models were trained using the preprocessed dataset. The training phase involved optimizing model parameters and fine-tuning their performance. Subsequently, the trained models were evaluated using separate test datasets to assess their accuracy and effectiveness in predicting fake news.

Result Analysis: The performance of each model was analyzed based on accuracy metrics and visualized using confusion matrices. This analysis provided insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the models, guiding further refinement and optimization efforts.

Conclusion and Future Work: The project concluded with a summary of findings and future prospects. While certain models demonstrated promising accuracy in predicting fake news, there remained opportunities for improvement through advanced techniques and larger datasets. Future work could explore deep learning approaches and incorporate real-time data streams for more robust detection capabilities.
